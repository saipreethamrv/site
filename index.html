		<p>I'm a Mechanical Engineering Undergrad at PES University with a flair for automobile engineering.
			I hold a good grasp of automotive components and machineries and possess the ability to absorb the concerned problem at first instance thereby providing the suitable remedial measure to the problem. I have demonstrated exceptional problem solving skills with respect to design and making of our racing kart that is a part of FSAE, Haya racing club. <br><br>Currently, I work as a Power train engineer for Haya and also the head of the Mechanical Engineering division of our space club, now building a rover built to survive mars-like environments. I also put out my ability to co-ordinate with the suppliers, technician and technologists to meet the target of our work ending in success.

		<p>As far as Haya, I am responsible for designing the Powertrain architecture for our vehicle which is a FSAE certfied race kart. I was also given the responsibility of desinging the intake diaphragm of our engine which proved to be a good success and leapt the team ahead compared to others.
		</p>
		</li>

			For Equinox, I single handedly desinged and put together the chasis of the rover that was mainly built to survive in martian environments. Now, I also work on the suspension and the desinging of the wheels so that the machine survives in harsh pathways.
